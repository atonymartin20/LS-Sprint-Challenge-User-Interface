1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    A. Semanitc HTML helps to make the html code easier to read and understand.  Rather than having a bunch of divs and trying to figure out where each div starts and ends, semantic HTML makes the code easier to read.  Semantic HTML also helps in terms of SEO and algorithms.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    A. Block elements display on a new line and take up a full width of a page regardless of their expected size.
        Exampes of block elements are divs, p tags, and lists.
        Inline elements display in the same line of other elements and only take up the space they require.
        Examples of inline elements are anchor tags, imgs, and spans.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    Margin, Border, Padding, and Content

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
    The opposite axis of the direction.  So if flex-direction is horizontal then align-items: center 
        will be the Y-axis.  If flex-direction is columns then align-items will be the X-axis.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
    Git is valuable to developers because projects can be rolled back to a previous version if something
        breaks or functions in a different way than it previously did.  Multiple users can work on the same
        set of files without affecting the others when operating on branches of the repo.
